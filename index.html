              <h2> Hello, my name is Miriam. </h2>
              
              <p>
                I am a physicist specialized mostly in quantum optics, numerical simulation, quantum computing and quantum information. <br>
                My primary occupation is an R&D position in the industry in a project related to Quantum Key Distribution. 
                There, I am responsible for research and implementation of the classical post-processing QKD phase -
                error correction with LDPC codes and privacy amplification. I also participate in the design and development 
                of a time-bin based QKD system simulator.</p>
              <p> I hold a PhD in Physics from the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. 
                The topic od my PhD research was modelling graphene nanostructures and their interaction 
                with light on a quantum level. 
                After finishing my PhD, I decided that I want to continue my research more into the direction of 
                classical and quantum (especially quantum) information theory, and I am now trying to evolve in this direction. </p>
              <p> Since quantum science right now is mostly a hobby for me, 
                I tend to just look for various problem that catch my interest. 
                I have always been very interested in diving deeper into the theory of relativity, 
                quantum field theory and their potential connections. However, lifetime is limited so 
                let's see whether someday I will have enough time and mental power to do that. </p>
              <p> My other hobbies include sport climbing and playing all sort of games. 
                I like classical literature, I love to sing and play a bit of the piano and ukulele. </p>
