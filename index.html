              <h2> Hello, my name is Miriam. </h2>
              
              <p>
                I am a physicist specialized mostly in quantum optics, numerical simulation, 2D materials, nanomaterials, 
                quantum cryptography and quantum computing.
                I hold a PhD in Physics from the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. 
                The topic od my PhD research was modelling graphene nanostructures and their interaction 
                with light on a quantum level. </p>
              <p> After finishing my PhD, I spent about three years working outside academia in R&D positions in the industry.
                I am involved in projects that aim to build commercial Quantum Key Distribution systems.
                I am mostly responsible for research and implementation of the classical post-processing QKD phase -
                error correction with LDPC codes and privacy amplification. I was also one of the leading developers 
                of a time-bin based QKD system simulator and analyzed various simulation results. </p>
              <p> I love to solve basically every kind of puzzles - 
                mathematical, scientific, verbal, crosswords, out-of-the-box thinking... 
                My other hobbies include <a href="https://www.8a.nu/user/miriam-k">sport climbing</a> and playing all sorts of games (list on <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/u/miriam_ko/">backloggd</a>). 
                I also like classical literature, theatre and I love to sing. 
                I quite enjoy science-fiction and fantasy books. Check out my short quiz about the Witcher saga <a href="witcher.html" target="_blank">here!</a> (in Polish!).</p>
